# Professional README.md and LICENSE Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This is a command line application that quickly generates a professional README file and LICENSE for your project, so that you can spend more valuable time writing your code.
