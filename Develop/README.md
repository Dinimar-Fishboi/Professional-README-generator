# Professional README.md and LICENSE Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This is a command line application that quickly generates a professional README file and LICENSE for your project, so that you can spend more valuable time writing your code.

## Installation

To install this program; clone this repository to your PC, initialise npm in your new repo (instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-init)), then install the inquirer package (instructions on that [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)).

## Usage

To start the program, type ‘node index.js’.

## Tests

This program will ask you the project Title, description, installation instructions, user guide, contribution information and any tests you recommend running on the system. For licensing and copyright purposes you will also be asked for your email, Git URL, full name/name of organisation ,year/s the project was worked on and to choose between one of four Licenses. This project doesn’t automatically upload the README and LICENSE, but will accept a ‘keysmash’ answer to be easily deleted later.

## Contributing

This is where you can advise how people can contribute. For this project,  all of the questions MUST be answered (as a .catch has been added to force the point); however the ability for folks to choose what parts of a README they require would make this a more versatile application.

## Questions

If you have any questions, please reach out to me.
